# Hugo's data directory.
# This can be used for various purposes including search indexes or
# other generated data that shouldn't be version controlled.
# If you have specific data files you *do* want to track,
# you'll need to explicitly re-include them.
# For example:
# !/data/my_important_data.json
/data/

# If you use Hugo's image processing, these are generated dynamically.
